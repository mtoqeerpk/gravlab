gravitom options panel

gravtiom is a program originally writen in FORTRAN by F.MASSON
This program computes the gravimetric anomaly of a 2D profile and is based on 
the Talwani's method (1969). gravitom2.1 is a simple conversion to MATLAB language that mimics
the result provided by gravitom as close as possible
the algorithm has been matrix oriented to be more suitable to MATLAB strengths

the curveviewer/curves/gravitom panel allow you to set gravitom input parameters :
    npts   :  integer describing the number of measurment you want for anomaly computation
    xmes   :  measurement locations along the x-axis
              in "linspace" mode, the values are linearily distributed between x-coordinate 0 and x-coordinate xmax
              the "file" mode is still not available
              the unit corresponds to the one used in the profilviewer
    zmes   :  measurement altitude, z-axis is oriented upward,
              in "constant" mode, the measurement alitude is fixed to a given value
              the unit corresponds to the one used in the profilviewer
    irecal :  this property allow you to remove the mean from the computed data and add the mean of an other curve to allow 
              them to be comparable on the same plot
              use the "to" menu to select the curve you want to scale to
    boundaries : to avoid boundary effects, the structure that join the right and left boundaries of 
              the profile are prolongated to a given distance in profil-unit. You can enable or disable this correction here
              and set the prolongation distance. The "distance" unit is the same as the one used in the profil viewer
    autorefresh : in later version, it should be possible to see the curve moving when modifying the structures on the profil viewer.

The output gravimertric anomaly is in mgal if the densities are expressed in g.cm^3
