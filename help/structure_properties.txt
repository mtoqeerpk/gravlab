single structure properties editor

this figure allow you to modify the properties of a single structure
the properties are : 
    name    :  name of the structure, this string will be writen in the .in file
               please avoid punctuation and white spaces. This field can stay undefined
    number of summits : 
               the global convention is to repeat the first summit. A triangle has 4 summits!
    density :  density of the structure, this can be a absolute value for model whitout holes
               or a relative value. To obtain gravimetric anomalies in mgal, use g/cm^3.
               (see gravitom2.1)
    order   :  contrary to previous versions, no correction is applied after mouse input to force
               the structure to be clockwise. You have to select the structure order here or in the profil editor.
               BE CAREFULL, a counter-clockwise structure gives a negative anomaly!!!
    color   :  this property can help you to identify the structures. A color is defined by its
               RGB code (RED/GREEN/BLUE). please use values between 0 and 1 and the Matlab's syntax
               for a 3-by-1 double array. See the colordisplay property descritpion for further details. 
               This property is not saved in the .in file
    colordisplay :
               here, you can select the display mode for this specific structure
               by default the structure is transparent. 
                   transparent : the structure has no color, you can see graphic objects which are under the structure
                   by_density  : the color is linearly related to the density. The colormap boundaries are fixed,
                                 1 is white, 4 is black
                   by_order    : clockwise structures appear in green while counterclockwise ones appear in red
                   by_color    : the structures are displayed according to their "color" properties
                   superposition_high :
                               : this display mode is the same as "by_color" but an alpha is added to make
                                 the structure a bit transparent, this helps to detect over impositions between
                                 neighbouring structures
    

The lower part of the figure gives the structure coordinates, you cannot modify it here (use Objects/modify instead)
the values are displayed in the profil units.

the buttons "permutation up" and "permutation down" allow you to permute the summits, this can solve some issues
for structures aligned with the profile boundaries, it is recommended to avoid the first (and last) summit
to be aligned with the profil boundaries.

Until you clic "ok" no modification is applied to the background data.
