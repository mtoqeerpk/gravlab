Profile properties editor :

This windows allow you to modify properties to each structure in the loaded
profile (.in).
When you clic "Apply" or "OK" at the bottom of the window, the properties 
in the upper pannel are read, applied to the Matlab's workspace variables,
and the graphical display is refreshed.
if you clic "Cancel" or close the properties editor, no change is applied to
Matlab's workspace variables

The upper panel describes the properties you want to attribuate to your structures.
The lower panel helps you to modify the upper panel for a set a selected structures

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
-> name
    type :
        string
    description :
        this allow you to recognize your structures, this properties is never used by the program,
        it can be empty and two structures can have the same name.
    syntax in the properties editor :
        no quotes, blanks are allowed but not recommended,
        blanks before first letter and after last letter won't be saved in the .in file
    variable name in MATLAB workspace :
        profil.model(i).name
        where i is the structure number (see the first column)
    save :
        this property is saved in the .in file and should be ignored by gravitom
        in case of problems, don't attribuate any name 
-> density
    type :
        doubble, scalar
    description :
        this describes the structure density, can be NaN.
        for gravimetric anomalies in mgal, use g/cm^3
    syntax in the properties editor :
        double
    variable name in MATLAB workspace :
        profil.model(i).rho
        where i is the structure number (see the first column)
    save :
        this property is saved in the .in file
-> order
    type :
        string
        'clockwise' or 'counterclockwise'
    description
        this describes in which order you want to sort your summits
        To have the correct anomaly signe, you have to turn it 'clockwise'
        turning it 'counterclockwise' can help you to identify the part of the anomaly curve which
        corresponds to your structure
    syntax in the properties editor :
        choose 'clockwise' or 'counterclockwise' with the popup menu
    variable name in MATLAB workspace :
        profil.model(i).order
        where i is the structure number (see the first column)
    save :
        this property is not directly saved in the .in file.
        But, when you save an .in file, the summits will be
        written in the order corresponding to this property.
        Then, when you load your .in file, this value is attribuated to the detected order,
        As a consequence you can condider that this properties is saved in the in file.
-> color
    type :
        3x1 element vector between 0 and 1
    description
        This properties help you to recognise your structures,
        you can define your own color conventions.
        This properties is never used by the program, to structures can have the same color.
        Be carefull, a structure can have a color but beeing displayed according to an other 
        proeperty like its density, its order, (see colordisplay property)...
    syntax in the properties editor :
        YOU MUST use brakets and comas,
        the values MUST be between 0 and 1!!!!
        (when you give a string, I simply evaluate this string using eval.m, so use MATLAB syntax please)
        example : 
            [ 0.1,0.16,1 ]
    variable name in MATLAB workspace :
        profil.model(i).color
        where i is the structure number (see the first column)    
    save :
        in version 1.0, colors are NOT saved. when you load your .in file,
        a color is attribuated to your structure according to its number in the file.
        should be improved in later versions.
-> color display :
    type :
        string
        'transparent','by_density','by_order','by_color' or 'superposition_high'
    description :
        this define how you want to display your structures,
            'transparent'        means no color, structure superposition will appear but could be a bit confusing
            'by_density'         means that the structure color is proportional to the density, NaN returns red
            'by_order'           displays a green structure if clockwise and a red one if counterclockwise
            'by_color'           displays the structure according to the color property
            'superposition_high' displays the structure according to the color property with a non-one alpha value
    syntax in the properties editor :
        choose the desired property using the popup menu
    variable name in MATLAB workspace :
        profil.model(i).colordisplay
    save :
        NOT saved in the .in file
        

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%              MODIFY A SELECTION OF SEVERAL STRUCTURES                   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

1/ MAKE THE SELECTION
    on the right, you can select a structure, when selected, the strucure
    is highligted in blue on the profilviewer
    The top-right button is the selector, this button has 4 positions "p1" to "p4"
    "p1" denotes the current selection
    "p2" reverses the selection
    "p3" selects all the structures
    "p4" deselects all the structures
    after "p4", the selector goes back to "p1" and you recover the original selection
    if you select or deselect a structure, the selector goes directly to "p1"

2/ MODIFY THE SELECTION
    to modify the current selection (blue icones on the upper panel), you can use the lower panel, 
    the line "mode" defines the kind of modification you want to apply
    the line "value" is interpreted depending on the "mode" property

    to modify the selection clic "OK & send", this do not modify the structures until you clic "OK"
    or "Apply"

    name : 
        mode "name=" : 
            this mode will atrubuate the string writen in the line "value" to selection
        mode "add prefix" :
            the string is added before the names of the selected structures
        mode "add suffix" :
            the string is added after the names of the selected structures    
        mode "name=struct number" :
            the selcted structure names are replaced by their numbers
    density :
        mode "dens=" :
            the selected structures' densities are replaced by the value specified in the line "value"
        mode "dens=dens+"
            the value specified in the line "value" is added to the selected structures' densities
        mode "dens=dens*"
            the value specified in the line "value" is multiplied to the selected structures' densities
    order :
        mode "order=":
            the selected structures' orders are set to the value specified below
        mode "invers order":
            all orders of the selection are reversed
    color : 
        mode "color=[r,g,b]":
            specify a color by giving its [r,g,b] code in line "value". this color will be attribuated to 
            the selection. Please use matlab syntax and values in range 0-1
            examples :  red is [1,0,0], orange is [1,.5,0]
        mode "inverse colors":
            all colors of the selected structures will be reversed. No value is required for this mode
    color display :
        mode "color display=":
            this mode will attribuate the display mode specified in the line "value"

3/ Don't forget to clic "OK" or "Apply" before closing the window, otherwhise, you modifications are lost
